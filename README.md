This is a fork of https://github.com/galetahub/ckeditor - for full documentation please see there.

This fork addresses issues with precompiling asset paths within its own JS.  Currently if you use the 'noasset' branch you can deploy JS and CSS that does not reference assets.  However, for various reasons, this means file upload will not work.  Attempts to solve this will be made on another branch.
